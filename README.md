# -Data-Representation

################Before Running##############

Please use jupyter notebook to open the .ipynb file.
Make sure all files are in the same roots.
You may need to change the path in the code to run parts of the code.

Then check if you install the python3.5 or higher version 
TensorFlow also required.

Careful with loading the model we have already trained.
We attached three of our different parameters setting network in one file.
It is required to change the path and select CNN which you want to use before you run it.

We do not attached  .h5 file in the final report due to the large size of the file itself. It is very easily to generate  on your own.

If there is any problem with running the code, please do not hesitate to contact me: Hang.Li@vub.be
